## Goal

Sick/Sicker with resource constraints in DES.

A continuation of * [Part 1](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/spgarbet/sick_sicker_des/master/Sick_Sicker_Simmer_DES.html).

The Sick/Simmer model constructed previously did not use the full power of
what discrete event simulation has to offer. This will build on the previous
work and include a demonstration of the effects of a resource constraint.

### Technical Details

One thing to be aware of is that if one were to execute each patient trajectory
as a simulation outside of a discrete event simulation (DES) framework it would
likely have much higher performance. A DES framework has to execute all trajectories
at the same time, evaluate them all to check for any resource contention and this
penalty is fixed whether or not the model has resource constraints. A large
number of cost effectiveness studies utilizing DES do not have constrained
resources. To put the problem in perspective, independent simulations are
$\mathcal{O}(n)$ in complexity of execution. Meaning the total time/memory
utilization is proportional to the number of individuals simulated. DES
requires the fixed cost of resource contention checking, and has to manage this
utilizing a heap and this makes the complexity $\mathcal{O}(n \log n)$. This is
a theoretical limitation based on complexity.

In earlier unpublished [work](https://github.com/spgarbet/sick_sicker_des) we[^1 Shawn Garbett, Fernando Alarid-Escudero, Cole Beck] quantified the differences using a Sick Sicker model.

This shows that in a practical case, when $N >= 10,000$ the 
simmer based DES solution because impractical. For our in house
models using simmer we batched them into units of 10,000 
patients and ran on 
[ACCRE](https://github.com/vubiostat/accre_tutorial). 

If one needs a full DES due to resource constraints, this problem is not
easily escaped--and the $N$ of simulation becomes the number contending
for a finite resource.
