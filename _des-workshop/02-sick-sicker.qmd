# Visualizing a DES

It is often useful to conceptualize a disease or health system process using a state transition diagram that captures mutually exclusive health states and possible transitions among them. 


:::{.cr-section}



@cr-bubble The state transition model here represents the underlying disease process for the didactic Markov cohort model in @alarid2023introductory. 

[@cr-bubble]{pan-to="50%,0%"} Patients start off healthy, and can then progress into progressive disease states ("Sick [S1]," "Sicker [S2]")---all while facing risks of death due to background causes, and heightened risk of death while sick.  

@cr-bubble

DES models are best visualized using a <span style="color:#007bdd">**Petri net diagram**</span>. 

@cr-petri1  Shown here is a Petri net for the same progressive disease model.  

In what follows, we will demonstrate how we conceptualized and constructed this Petri net diagram for a DES. @cr-petri1

Doing so will allow us to expand the decision problem to consider an additional dimension---resource contention for a scarce treatment---that is difficult/impossible to capture in Markov and microsimulation modeling approaches. @cr-petri2

# Progressive Disease Model


:::{.cr-section layout="overlay-center"}

@cr-model1  We start with a simple model that follows patients for $T$ time units. 

In this simple model, we have a population of "tokens" that start off in the healthy state. [@cr-model1]{pan-to="65%, 20%" scale-by="1.5"}

To begin, we will assume this population can only experience one event: [@cr-model1]{pan-to="-50%, -35%"} reaching the end of the simulation at some time T. 

@cr-model1

:::{#cr-model1}
![](images/petri-model1.png){fig-align="center"}
:::


:::


:::{.cr-section}

Our first step is to define the parameters governing the simulation. In this case the list of parameters is small. @cr-inputs0

:::{#cr-inputs0}
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| code-line-numbers: true
#| 
inputs <- list(
    N       = 1,  # Total number of patients to simulate. 
    horizon = 30  # Time horizon (years)
)

```
:::
:::

:::{.cr-section layout="overlay-center"}

:::{#cr-model1_2}
![](images/petri-model1.png){fig-align="center"}
:::

@cr-model1_2 We next need to step back and think about two concepts we defined above: <span style="color:#79AF97FF">**resources**</span> and <span style="color:#00A1D5FF">**events**</span>. 

Let's think first about <span style="color:#9FA8DA">**resources**</span>. Resources are elements that a patient may use or consume during their time in the simulation. We use the terms "use" and "consume" somewhat loosely here, because a resource could be something like a hospital bed that is needed for treatment---or it could simply be an element like time that is not constrained. 

In this very simple model, we need to conceptualize our first resource, which is <span style="color:#9FA8DA">**time in model**</span>. 

The image here shows a single patient trajectory over time. We begin tracking the patient at baseline (t=0) and follow them until the end of the time horizon has been met at 30 years. @cr-model1-resources0

We can therefore define a resource called <span style="color:#9FA8DA">**time in model**</span> that we track. In this case, it will trivially be 30 years for every simulated patient.  @cr-model1-resources1 

:::{#cr-model1-resources0}
![](images/model1-resources0.png)
:::

:::{#cr-model1-resources1}
![](images/model1-resources1.png)
:::

But that does not always need to be the case! Suppose the patient dies at some time before t=30. In that case, their time in the model will be shorter. @cr-model1-resources1-death

:::{#cr-model1-resources1-death}
![](images/model1-resources1-death.png)
:::

It's also important to note that in this example patient trajectory, the resource `time_in_model` is unconstrained. That is, one simulated patient's experience of time does not inhibit or limit another patient from also experiencing the elapse of time. 

@cr-model1-resources1 Because the patient is followed for a defined time horizon, we can think of the resource as beginning at the initiation of the model, and ending after the time horizon is met. 

@cr-model1-resources2 The way DES conceptualizes this idea is that the resource is "seized" upon initiation of the model, and then "released" upon exit from the model. These two time stamps can then be used to calculate the total time the resource was "used." 

:::{#cr-model1-resources1}
![](images/model1-resources2.png)
:::

@cr-model1-resources2 Often, the seizure and/or release of resources is triggered by <span style="color:#F44336">**events**</span>. We'll cover how to handle events in just a bit. 

:::{#cr-model1-resources2}
![](images/model1-resources2.png)
:::


@cr-countertable0 

Resources are tracked in a **counter** object. In this very simple model, we only have a single resource to track: `time_in_model`.

:::{#cr-countertable0}
: DES Model Counters

| counter | description |
|---------|-------------|
| time_in_model | Time (years) patient is tracked in model |
:::



In R, the object `counters` is defined as a vector listing the various resources that we want to track in the model. @cr-counter0 

@cr-counter0

:::{#cr-counter0}
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| code-line-numbers: true
#| 
counters <- c(
  "time_in_model"
)

```
:::

:::

Our next step is to define <span style="color:#F44336">**events**</span>. In this simple model, we have two:


  1. Model initiation
  2. Model exit after the specified horizon has been reached.




:::{.cr-section layout="overlay-center"}

@cr-model1-event1

Both of these events trigger resource seizure and/or release, in the sense that when a patient is initialized in the model,
we want to start the clock on the `time_in_model` counter. [@cr-model1-event2]{pan-to="50%, -60%" scale-by="2"}

And similarly, when the patient reaches the event of exiting the model at the defined time horizon, we want to stop the clock on `time_in_model`.  [@cr-model1-event2]{pan-to="-50%, -60%" scale-by="2"}

@cr-model1-event2

:::{#cr-model1-event1}
![](images/model1-event1.png)
:::

:::{#cr-model1-event2}
![](images/model1-event2.png)
:::


In the R/Simmer simulation environment, events are handled through functions that modify the trajectory of the patient.

Let's start by defining an event for model initialization. @cr-Rinitialize1

:::{#cr-Rinitialize1}
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| code-line-numbers: true
initialize_patient <- function(traj, inputs)
{
  traj                   |>
  seize("time_in_model") 
}
```
:::

:::{#cr-Rinitialize2}
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| code-line-numbers: true
initialize_patient <- function(traj, inputs)
{
  traj                   |>
  seize("time_in_model") |>
  set_attribute("AgeInitial", function() sample(20:30, 1))
}
```
:::

[@cr-Rinitialize1]{highlight="1"} `initialize_patient` is a function of both **inputs** (i.e., the parameters governing the model) and **trajectories**. 

[@cr-Rinitialize1]{highlight="3"} It takes the patient's trajectory and **seizes** the resource `time_in_model` that we defined above. [@cr-Rinitialize1]{highlight="4"}

[@cr-model1-event2]{pan-to="50%, -60%" scale-by="2"} Going back to the single patient trajectory, upon initilization of the patient we have "seized" the `time_in_model` resource for this patient. 

[@cr-Rinitialize2]{highlight="5"} Though we don't need it for this very simple model, `initialize_patient` is also a good place to set initial attributes of patients, such as their age, gender, etc. We can then use (and update!) these attributes in the model so they can govern transitions and other events. 

@cr-Rinitialize2


Let's now construct a similar function `terminate_simulation()` that releases the resource `time_in_model` once a patient exits the model. 


:::


:::{.cr-section}

:::{#cr-Rcleanup0}
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| code-line-numbers: true

terminate_simulation <- function(traj, inputs)
{
  traj |>
  branch( function() 1, 
          continue=FALSE,
          trajectory() |> 
            release("time_in_model")
        )
}
```
:::

[@cr-Rcleanup0]{highlight="4"} 

In this function, we take the patient's trajectory and introduce a **branch**. You can think of this like a chance node in a decision tree---this puts our patient at a fork in the road, and each pathway has its own probability of being taken.

In this case, however, the patient is exiting the model. So this is a trivial function with only one option that has a probability of one. 

[@cr-Rcleanup0]{highlight="5"} The option `continue` is also set to false---indicating that after this branch has been passed, the model will stop running.  

Branches are key coding elements of DES, and allow for updating event times and other aspects of the model that may change over time, or probabilistically due to the occurance of events. In the event a branch is used to update attributes or event times, you woulld set `continue=TRUE`. 

Branches will also be key for how we conceptualize and model resource constraints later on.


[@cr-Rcleanup0]{highlight="7"} Once the patient has passed through the branch, we release the resource `time_in_model`. 


@cr-Rcleanup1 In our experience, it is often helpful to split this process into two parts: <span class="hl hl-cyan">A function that releases any resources on exit</span>. [@cr-Rcleanup1]{highlight="1-5"} 


[@cr-Rcleanup1]{highlight="7-15"} And a separate <span class="hl hl-cyan">function that terminates the simulation</span> .

# Scratch

:::{.cr-section layout="overlay-center"}
The first thing we want to track is the trajectory of the patient through the model. 

We need to initialize the patient @cr-model1-init

@cr-model2  We'll next add in a death state. 

@cr-model3. Now we allow for two health states: healthy and sick. 

@cr-model4  We can allow for an event transition back to the healthy state.

@cr-model5 We add in progressive disease. 

@cr-model6 And finally, we add in a treatment with resource constraints (e.g., limited beds, surgical appointment spots, etc.)

Petri nets offer a **graphical grammar** that aligns neatly with discrete-event
simulation (DES):

| *Place* | ● (circle) | Clinical states (`H`, `S1`, `S2`), queues, resources |

# Model 1


:::{.cr-section layout="overlay-center"}


For our first (very simple!) DES we will model a system that initiates in a healthy state ... [@cr-petri1]{pan-to="50%,50%" scale-by="2"}

[@cr-petri1]{pan-to="50%,-50%" scale-by="2"}  ... and then follows patients for a defined 30-year time horizon. 

[@cr-petri1]{pan-to="-50%,-50%" scale-by="1"} 

@cr-petri1

Later, we will build up this very simple DES by incorporating additional components such as health state transitions, background mortality, and resource queues.

Think of a counter like a scoreboard that lists race times, including times for each lap (event) in the race. For our simple model, our counter will operate exactly like this---it will simply track the amount of time each patient spends in the model. 



:::{.cr-section}

Counters are defined as a vector object that provides the names of each event we want to track in the model. This vector will be used later with a convenience function we have written for `Simmer` ( `main_loop()`) to define resources with infinite capacity, i.e., there is no competition for a resource like "time in model"). @cr-counters0

For this very simple model, we will simply track patients for a defined time horizon of 30 years.  Thus, our first `counter` will be `time_in_model`. @cr-counters

:::{#cr-counters0}
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
#| code-line-numbers: false

counters <- c(
  #<names of counters go here>
)
```
:::

:::{#cr-counters}
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false

counters <- c(
  "time_in_model"
)
```

:::
:::


## Initializing Patients

We next need to define a process that will initialize patients in the model. Extending the racing analogy further, think of this process in terms of defining the pole positions of each "car" in the race: we want to define baseline attributes, like:

- Age
- Disease status (e.g., healthy, ill)
- Gender

The pipe operator |> in R is a tool for chaining operations together in a left-to-right, readable sequence. Instead of nesting functions or creating intermediate variables, you "pipe" the output of one function directly into the next function as its first argument.

:::

:::{.cr-section layout="sidebar-right"}
For example, this syntax using pipe operators ... 
@cr-pipesyntax

:::{#cr-pipesyntax}
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

```
:::

:::{.cr-section layout="sidebar-right"}

@cr-pipesyntax2  
... is equivalent to:
@cr-pipesyntax2

:::{#cr-pipesyntax2}
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

function3(function2(function1(data)))
```

:::
:::

Let's now define a function `initialize_patient()` to define the starting state of a patient. This can be as complex as needed to define the attributes of the starting population of a study.

::: {.column-screen style="background-image:url(images/starting-line-cars2.png); background-size: 100vw; height: 500px; background-position: center bottom; background-repeat: no-repeat; opacity: 0.25"}
:::



:::{.cr-section }
Our function has two inputs: `traj` and `inputs`. [@cr-initialize]{highlight="1"}  The object `inputs` are the parameters that define our model, and were defined above (and are also stored in `inputs.R`). 

A trajectory (`traj`) is a sequence of events that defines what happens to people as they move through the DES. You can think of `traj` in terms of a personalized race course for each person in the model. 

In our code here, for a given patient we start with its trajectory [@cr-initialize]{highlight="3"}

We then feed this trajectory into the simmer function `seize()`. [@cr-initialize]{highlight="4"} This function siezes the counter `time_in_model`  that we defined above. You can think of this step in terms of taking our patient and directing them to the starting line of the simulation.   

The `initialize_patient()` function is also our opportunity to set baseline attributes of our patients. For example, here we sample the patient's age in years from a uniform distribution between age 20 and 30. [@cr-initialize]{highlight="5"} This attribute isn't actually going to be used for now; we include it here simply to demonstrate how baseline attributes can be set. You can define as many of these attributes as needed to execute the model. 


@cr-initialize


:::{#cr-initialize}
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: true
initialize_patient <- function(traj, inputs)
{
  traj                   |>
  seize("time_in_model") |>
  set_attribute("AgeInitial", function() sample(20:30, 1))
}
```
:::


:::

:::{.cr-section layout="overlay-center"}
**NOTE**: It is important when using simmer to mostly pass functions for defining things in a trajectory. This is a call back, and if not done properly it can result in puzzling behavior. If one passed to simmer the following: `sample(20:30,1)`, it would result in a single random draw applied to every single patient. For example, if 25 were draw every patient would be 25. Instead one needs to pass to simmer `function() sample(20:30,1)` to get a random draw for each patient resulting a uniform spread of this parameter. If every patient had the same attribute being assigned, it would be fine to leave off the `function()`, but this can lead to forgetting to do it in cases where it's needed and it doesn't hurt to leave it in on all calls. @cr-initialize
:::


## Define the Finish Line

The steps above were used to define the starting line and to define the dimensions we want to track and measure. The last step is to define where the model should end. That is, how do we define the "end" of the patient's trajectory through the system? Once we define this end, we need to "release" the various counters (e.g., time in model) and resources we've defined. 

We'll do this using a series of "cleanup" functions that release the patient at the end of their journey through the model. 

::: {.column-screen style="background-image:url(images/finish-line-cars.png); background-size: 100vw; height: 300px; background-position: center 35%; background-repeat: no-repeat; opacity: 0.5"}
:::
<figcaption>Image generated by ChatGPT 4o</figcaption>

:::{.cr-section}

When a patient leaves the simulation via any means it is helpful to have a function that examines the state or attributes of that patient/trajectory and releases any resources they used. @cr-cleanup

[@cr-cleanup]{highlight="1-5"} In this section, we know they've seized `time_in_model`, so they need to let that go when they exit.

This function can get a lot more complex as patient state grows more complex.


[@cr-cleanup]{highlight="7-14"} This routine terminates the trajectory and calls the above cleanup. These two pieces could easily have been one function, but keeping them separate has proven useful in practice, primarily for organizational purposes.


:::{#cr-cleanup}
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: true

cleanup_on_termination <- function(traj)
{
  traj |> 
  release("time_in_model")
}

terminate_simulation <- function(traj, inputs)
{
  traj |>
  branch( function() 1, 
          continue=FALSE,
          trajectory() |> cleanup_on_termination()
        )
}

```

:::
:::

## Event Registry

Now we're approaching the heart of the model. The event registry. We're going to define a single event to terminate the patient trajectory when the defined time horizon is reached. For a full life simulation such a function isn't needed as a proper mortality model would have individuals simulated die at some point, however it's not bad to have something like this to prevent a run away simulation.


:::{.cr-section}

Here's how it looks for a single entry. @cr-registry

:::{#cr-registry}
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: true

event_registry <- list(
  list(name          = "Terminate at time horizon",
       attr          = "aTerminate",
       time_to_event = function(inputs) inputs$horizon,
       func          = terminate_simulation,
       reactive      = FALSE)
)
```
:::

[@cr-registry]{highlight="2"} The `name` field is for debugging purposes and may come up on a simmer trace. It's not used much in practice. 

[@cr-registry]{highlight="3"} `attr` is the name of the attribute on a patient used to store the time to event. It needs to be unique and not correspond to any other attribute name defined on the patient. 

[@cr-registry]{highlight="4"} `time_to_event` is a callback function that defines how long till the event occurs. Simulation time starts at 0 and proceeds forward. 

[@cr-registry]{highlight="4"}  In this model we have chosen the cycle to each a year. Thus when time reaches 2.0, that's 2 years into the simulation for that patient---*not their age*. 

[@cr-registry]{highlight="5"} The `func` is the callback function that will modify the state of the patient, in this case it's the terminate simulation function defined above.

[@cr-registry]{highlight="6"}  The `reactive` field is a logical TRUE/FALSE that defines whether all other events should be redraw if this event fires. In this case the patient trajectory is ending, so no events for them should be redrawn.

## Tracking Outcomes 

### Quality of Life (QoL)

:::{.cr-section }

@cr-QoL

:::{#cr-QoL}

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: true

qaly_arrivals <- function(arrivals, inputs)
{
  arrivals$qaly  <- 0  # No qaly yet
  arrivals$dqaly <- 0  # No discounted qaly either
  
  selector <- arrivals$resource == 'time_in_model'
  arrivals$qaly[selector] <-
    arrivals$end_time[selector] - 
    arrivals$start_time[selector]
  arrivals$dqaly[selector] <- 
      discount_value(1, 
                     arrivals$start_time[selector],
                     arrivals$end_time[selector])
    
  arrivals
}

```
:::
:::



### Costs

We need to define incured costs for our model. It should take the data.frame from `des_run` and add cost columns for the resources. We pass in the inputs as they might be needed. We will ignore the costs for healthy till we can add that state later.

:::{.cr-section}

@cr-costs

:::{#cr-costs}

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: true
cost_arrivals <- function(arrivals, inputs)
{
  arrivals$cost  <- 0  # No costs yet
  arrivals$dcost <- 0  # No discounted costs either
  
  arrivals
}
```

:::
:::




:::{.cr-section}

The function `des_run` is the primary simulation function. @cr-desrun1

[@cr-desrun1]{highlight="3"} The first step is to create a global environment used to run simmer. This is followed by creating a des definition of a trajectory (this function is in `main_loop`. It uses the things we've defined above.

[@cr-desrun1]{highlight="4"}  The patient trajectory (`traj`) is defined by our helper function `des()`, which can be found in `main_loop.R`. It essentially creates a patient, assigns attributes and events, and processes the events. Think of this function as the one that runs a single car through the race course. 

[@cr-desrun1]{highlight="5-10"}   `env` is given resources or counters, patients are generated into the simulation, the simulation is run for an amount of time (just past the horizon) and then the `wrap` makes sure all summaries are ready.

[@cr-desrun1]{highlight="12"} `get_mon_arrival` returns us the trajectories of the patients in a `data.frame`. We will expand on this quite a bit later. It really the soul of understanding what's going on in a simulation and critical for auditing and validation of expectations about a model as we demonstrate later.

[@cr-desrun1]{highlight="13-14"} We add in cost and health outcomes.

:::{#cr-desrun1}
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: true
des_run <- function(inputs)

# Model 2: A Simple Mortality Model

Our first addition to the simple model will be to add background mortality. 

:::{.cr-section layout="overlay-center"}

@cr-petri2

We have added the possibility of death as an event that can occur before the patient reaches the end of the time horizon  ... [@cr-petri2]{pan-to="35%,50%" scale-by="1.5"}

@cr-petri2

Our next objective is to add an event---death---to the model.

1. Add event to counter
2. Define function for time till event
3. Define function to mark and update the patient trajectory
4. Add event to event registry

:::{.cr-section}
Add death to the counter @cr-counter2

:::{#cr-counter2}
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: true
  
  counters <- c(
    "time_in_model",
    "death"
  )
```
:::

Next we define a function to sample time till event @cr-yearstodeath

:::{#cr-yearstodeath}
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: true

years_till_death <- function(inputs)
{
  rexp(1, inputs$r.HD)
}
```

:::

@cr-deathevent

Net we define a function to mark and update the patient registry. 

:::{#cr-deathevent}
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: true

death <- function(traj, inputs)
{
  traj |> branch(
    function() 1,
    continue=c(FALSE), # False is patient death, had to use a branch to force termination
    trajectory("Death") |>
      mark("death")     |> # Must be in 'counters'
      terminate_simulation()
  )
}
```

:::

 @cr-registry2

Finally, we add the event to the event registry. [ @cr-registry2]{highlight="7-11"}

:::{#cr-registry2}
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: true

event_registry <- list(
  list(name          = "Terminate at time horizon",
       attr          = "aTerminate",
       time_to_event = function(inputs) inputs$horizon,
       func          = terminate_simulation,
       reactive      = FALSE),
  list(name          = "Death",
       attr          = "aDeath",
       time_to_event = years_till_death,
       func          = death,
       reactive      = TRUE)
)
```

:::

:::

Let's run the model and look at the output. 

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

des_run(inputs)
```

:::{.cr-section layout="overlay-center"}

:::{#cr-res2_1}

```{r}
#| echo: false
library(kableExtra)
set.seed(23)
df <- des_run(inputs)
df %>%
  kbl() %>%
  kable_styling() 
```
:::

:::{#cr-res2_2}

```{r}
#| echo: false
df %>%
  kbl() %>%
  kable_styling() %>%
  row_spec(c(1), background = "#fff3cd") 

```
:::

:::{#cr-res2_3}

```{r}
#| echo: false
df %>%
  kbl() %>%
  kable_styling() %>%
  row_spec(c(2), background = "#fff3cd") 

```
:::

@cr-res2_1

@cr-res2_2 Notice how this patient dies before the 30-year time horizon. The `resource` column
indicates that the death event occurred for this patient, and the `start_time` column indicates the time at which the event occurred (`r round(df$start_time[1],2)` years). 

@cr-res2_3 In total, and as a result of early death, this patient contributed `r round(df$dqaly[2],2)` discounted QALYs to the simulated population.

# Model 3: Adding in a Sick State

Our next addition is to add disease incidence to the model. 

:::{.cr-section layout="overlay-center"}

@cr-petri3

We have added the possibility of transitions to a diseased state ("S") a  ... [@cr-petri3]{pan-to="35%,30%" scale-by="1.5"}

@cr-petri3

:::{.cr-section}

Need a lookup table for numeric mapping to health states. @cr-statelut

:::{#cr-statelut}
```{r}

#| code-line-numbers: true

state_lut <- c(
  "0" = "H",

sick1 <- function(traj, inputs)
{
  traj                      |> 
  set_attribute("State", 1) |> # 1 => Sick 1 (S1)
  release('healthy')        |> # Track state change for tally later
  seize('sick1')
}

Also need to update death event to account for higher risk of death @cr-death3

:::{#cr-death3}

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: true

years_till_death <- function(inputs)
{

  rate <- inputs$r.HD
  if(state == 1) rate <- rate * inputs$hr.S1D # Deal with Sick1 Hazard Ratio
  rexp(1, rate)

And update QoL and Costs to account for costs and utility weight while sick @cr-outcomes3_1

Then @cr-outcomes3_2

:::{#cr-outcomes3_1}

```{r}
